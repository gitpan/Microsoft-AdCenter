=head1 NAME

Microsoft::AdCenter - An interface which abstracts Microsoft adCenter API.

=cut

our $VERSION = '7.05';

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This collection of modules makes interacting with Microsoft adCenter APIs as easy as possible.

B<Note that this version (7.x) is intended to be used with version 7 of Microsoft adCenter API.>

Sample Usage:

    use Microsoft::AdCenter::CampaignManagementService;
    use Microsoft::AdCenter::CampaignManagementService::Bid;
    use Microsoft::AdCenter::CampaignManagementService::Keyword;

    # Create the service client
    my $campaign_mgmt_service = Microsoft::AdCenter::CampaignManagementService->new(
        ApplicationToken  => "your_application_token",
        CustomerAccountId => "your_customer_account_id",
        CustomerId        => "your_customer_id",
        DeveloperToken    => "your_developer_token",
        Password          => "your_password",
        UserName          => "your_user_name"
    );

    # Create a Keyword object
    my $keyword = Microsoft::AdCenter::CampaignManagementService::Keyword->new
        ->Text("some text")
        ->BroadMatchBid(Microsoft::AdCenter::CampaignManagementService::Bid->new->Amount(0.1))
        ->ExactMatchBid(Microsoft::AdCenter::CampaignManagementService::Bid->new->Amount(0.1));

    # Call AddKeywords
    my $response = $campaign_mgmt_service->AddKeywords(
        AdGroupId => "",
        Keywords => [$keyword]
    );

    # Check the response
    my $keyword_ids = $response->KeywordIds;
    ...

=head1 VERSIONING

This version of Microsoft::AdCenter is intended to be used with V7 of Microsoft adCenter API.  If you need to access both V6 and V7 simultaneously, you'll need to install 2 versions of Microsoft::AdCenter.  In order to have 2 versions of the same perl module installed, you'll need to put one in a non-standard location, for example ~/perl/.  See perldoc CPAN for more information.

=head1 OVERVIEW

Microsoft adCenter API allows you to manage your adCenter account in an automated fashion rather than manually.  The API is exposed as a standard SOAP service that you can make calls to.  This set of modules is designed to make using the SOAP service easier than using SOAP::Lite (for example) directly.  There are 2 main types of modules available.  The service modules (AdministrationService, CampaignManagementService, CustomerManagementService, etc) are used to make the actual calls to each of the SOAP services in the API.  The other type of module provided are the complex type modules, each of which represents one of the complex types defined in one of the WSDLs of the SOAP service.  Examples include Campaign, AdGroup, Ad, Keyword, etc.

The calls you can make to the various services are documented on MSDN.  See

L<http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee730328%28v=MSADS.70%29.aspx>

Where the documentation indicates that a complex type must be passed in to a particular service call, you must pass in the appropriate
Microsoft::AdCenter::ComplexType object.  For example, CampaignManagementService->AddCampaigns requires that an array of Campaigns be passed in:

    use Microsoft::AdCenter::CampaignManagementService;
    use Microsoft::AdCenter::CampaignManagementService::Campaign;

    # Create the service client
    my $campaign_mgmt_service = Microsoft::AdCenter::CampaignManagementService->new(
        ApplicationToken  => "your_application_token",
        CustomerAccountId => "your_customer_account_id",
        CustomerId        => "your_customer_id",
        DeveloperToken    => "your_developer_token",
        Password          => "your_password",
        UserName          => "your_user_name"
    );

    # Create a Campaign object
    my $campaign = Microsoft::AdCenter::CampaignManagementService::Campaign->new
        ->BudgetType("MonthlyBudgetDivideDailyAcrossMonth")
        ->ConversionTrackingEnabled("false")
        ->DaylightSaving("true")
        ->Description("the campaign description")
        ->MonthlyBudget(1000)
        ->Name("the campaign name")
        ->TimeZone("EasternTimeUSCanada")

    # Call AddCampaigns
    my $response = $campaign_mgmt_service->AddCampaigns(
        AccountId => "",
        Campaigns => [$campaign]
    );

    # Check the response
    my $campaign_ids = $response->CampaignIds;
    ...

Note that all simple types referenced in the WSDLs are automatically handled for you - just pass in an appropriate string, and let Microsoft::AdCenter do the rest.

When a method expects an array of objects / strings / numbers / etc., you must pass an array reference.

If the SOAP call succeeded, you will receive a response object.  See the perldoc for the specific service client module for the return types.

If a SOAP Fault is encountered (whenever a call fails), the service client will throw a Microsoft::AdCenter::SOAPFault object.

=head1 METHODS

There are no methods available in Microsoft::AdCenter directly.  All functionality is exposed by the various service client modules and complex types.

=head1 EXAMPLES

=head2 Example 1 - Create a new campaign

    use Microsoft::AdCenter::CampaignManagementService;
    use Microsoft::AdCenter::CampaignManagementService::Campaign;

    # Create the service client
    my $campaign_mgmt_service = Microsoft::AdCenter::CampaignManagementService->new
        ->ApplicationToken("your_application_token")
        ->CustomerAccountId("your_customer_account_id")
        ->CustomerId("your_customer_id")
        ->DeveloperToken("your_developer_token")
        ->Password("your_password")
        ->UserName("your_user_name");

    # Create a Campaign object
    my $campaign = Microsoft::AdCenter::CampaignManagementService::Campaign->new
        ->BudgetType("MonthlyBudgetDivideDailyAcrossMonth")
        ->ConversionTrackingEnabled("false")
        ->DaylightSaving("true")
        ->Description("the campaign description")
        ->MonthlyBudget(1000)
        ->Name("the campaign name")
        ->TimeZone("EasternTimeUSCanada")

    # Call AddCampaigns
    my $response = $campaign_mgmt_service->AddCampaigns(
        AccountId => "",
        Campaigns => [$campaign]
    );

    # Check the response header
    my $tracking_id = $campaign_mgmt_service->response_header->{TrackingId};

    # Check the response
    my $campaign_ids = $response->CampaignIds;
    ...

=head2 Example 2 - Get accounts

    use Microsoft::AdCenter::CustomerManagementService;

    # Create the service client
    my $customer_mgmt_service = Microsoft::AdCenter::CustomerManagementService->new(
        UserName         => "your_user_name",
        Password         => "your_password",
        ApplicationToken => "your_application_token",
        DeveloperToken   => "your_developer_token"
    );

    # Get accounts
    my $response = $customer_mgmt_service->GetAccountsInfo(CustomerId => "your_customer_id");

    # Check the response
    foreach my $account (@{$response->GetAccountsResult}) {
        ...
    }

=head2 Example 3 - Error handling

    use Microsoft::AdCenter::CampaignManagementService;
    use Microsoft::AdCenter::CampaignManagementService::Bid;
    use Microsoft::AdCenter::CampaignManagementService::Keyword;

    # Create the service client
    my $campaign_mgmt_service = Microsoft::AdCenter::CampaignManagementService->new(
        ApplicationToken  => "your_application_token",
        CustomerAccountId => "your_customer_account_id",
        CustomerId        => "your_customer_id",
        DeveloperToken    => "your_developer_token",
        Password          => "INVALID PASSWORD", # An invalid password
        UserName          => "your_user_name"
    );

    my $response;
    eval {
        $response = $campaign_mgmt_service->AddKeywords(
            AdGroupId => "",
            Keywords => [
                Microsoft::AdCenter::CampaignManagementService::Keyword->new
                    ->Text("some text")
                    ->BroadMatchBid(Microsoft::AdCenter::CampaignManagementService::Bid->new->Amount(0.1))
                    ->ExactMatchBid(Microsoft::AdCenter::CampaignManagementService::Bid->new->Amount(0.1))
            ]
        );
    };
    if (my $e = $@) {
        print "Fault code: @{[$e->faultcode]}\n";
        print "Fault string: @{[$e->faultstring]}\n";
        print "Error messages:\n";
        print $_->Message . "\n" foreach @{$e->detail->Errors};
    }

=head1 DEBUGGING

If you'd like to see the SOAP requests and responses, or other debugging information available from SOAP::Lite, you can turn it on just as you would for SOAP::Lite.  See perldoc SOAP::Trace.  As an example, if you wanted to see all trace information available, you could add the following to the module or script you use Microsoft::AdCenter in:

 use SOAP::Lite +trace;
